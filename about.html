<p>Daniel Work is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and
the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. Prior to
joining the faculty at Vanderbilt, Prof. Work was most recently an associate
professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (tenured), the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (courtesy), and the Coordinated
Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Work was a
senior fellow at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of
California, Los Angeles in 2015. Prof. Work earned his bachelor of science degree
(2006) from the Ohio State University, and a master of science (2007) and Ph.D.
(2010) from the University of California, Berkeley, each in civil engineering. Prior to
joining the faculty at Illinois as an assistant professor in 2010, Work was a research
intern at Nokia Research Center, Palo Alto from 2008-2009, and a guest researcher
at Microsoft Research Redmond in 2010.</p>

<p>Prof. Work has research expertise transportation cyber physical systems, connected
and autonomous vehicles, and transportation data analytics. He currently serves as
associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems and
Transportation Research Part C – Emerging Technologies, and is a member of the
IEEE Technical Committee on Cybernetics for Cyber-Physical Systems and the ASCE
Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Impacts Committee. Work’s research on
autonomous vehicles has appeared in numerous media outlets including Wired, MIT
Technology Review, Forbes, and Smithsonian Magazine. Prof. Work has received a
number of honors and awards including being named a 2018 Gilbreth Lecturer by
