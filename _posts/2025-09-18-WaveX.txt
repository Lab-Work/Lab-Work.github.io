Powered by data from the TDOT I-24 MOTION testbed, our team has developed a generative AI framework that transforms conventional radar sensor data into fine-grained traffic insights - particularly for reconstructing stop-and-go traffic waves.

The peer-reviewed journal article detailing the techinical details was published in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies. The [article can be found here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X23003005). The dataset described in the TR-C article is now [available for download](https://zenodo.org/records/17122740)!

Building on this work, we have recently received support from the [NVIDIA Academic Grant Program], granting us access to 32,000 hours of A100 GPU compute for further development.
