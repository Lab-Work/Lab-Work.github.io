Davis H. Elliot Company is heading up construction work on I-24 MOTION. Work is progressing on ITS communication infrastructure, camera poles, and networking. Construction and testing are expected to conclude in September, 2022. Over ten truckloads of poles, a total of 120 steel sections, are being collected in a staging area. Around 300 cameras and 100 network switches will be delivered to the project over the coming months. Testing of each component is conducted before installation and the completed system will undergo multiple rounds of testing before the end of the project.
