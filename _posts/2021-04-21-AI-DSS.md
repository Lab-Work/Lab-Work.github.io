Funding was secured last year for Vanderbilt's participation in a $5.2 million (total) grant from the US Department of Transportation to bring artificial intelligence to integrated corridor management (ICM) on I-24. A variety of ICM strategies are being deployed on the corridor, such as dynamic message signs, changeable speed limits, ramp metering, V2X communication, and more -- all of which will be accounted for by the AI engine that recommends ICM actions for responding to congestion incidents.
