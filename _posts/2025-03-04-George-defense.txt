Dr. George Gunter successfully defended his PhD dissertation on "Formal safety and cyber-security of mixed-autonomy traffic" on March 4, 2025. His work focused on the critical challenge of ensuring safety as automated vehicles (AVs) join our roadways alongside human drivers in mixed-autonomy traffic. Congratulations George!
