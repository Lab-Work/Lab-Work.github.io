A variety of ICM strategies are being deployed on the corridor, such as dynamic message signs, changeable speed limits, ramp metering, V2X communication, and more – all of which will be accounted for by the AI engine that recommends ICM actions for responding to congestion incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

The research will seek to improve the effectiveness of integrated corridor management (ICM) systems like the ongoing I-24 Smart Corridor project. The I-24 corridor is a critical part of Nashville’s growing congestion and forms the critical link to Murfreesboro. A variety of ICM strategies are being deployed on the corridor, such as dynamic message signs, changeable speed limits, ramp metering, V2X communication, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project will be supported by a multidisciplinary team: Craig Philip, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportation and Operational Resiliency (VECTOR); Janos Sztipanovits, director of the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS); and Eric Hall, staff engineer at ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis was performed across all major US metro areas and showed large susceptibility in transit-heavy cities – modest mode switch from transit to personal vehicles could increase all road users’ travel times by 5-10 minutes each way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very small travel time increases (e.g., less than 5 minutes one-way) may not seem concerning, this could equate to hundreds of thousands of additional hours spent in traffic each day. It certainly highlights the importance of transit in major cities to keep vehicle volumes at manageable levels.&lt;/p&gt;

They presented their work on automatic data cleaning for urban sensor networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low cost urban sensing networks enhance our understanding of cites and urban life. IThe impacts of mitigation strategies in communities can be measured at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this project applies robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is applied to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrayofthings.github.io/&quot;&gt;Array of Things (AoT)&lt;/a&gt; city-scale sensor network. Located in the City of Chicago, IL, AoT collects real time data on the city’s environment and activity with more than 90 nodes. Further analysis of AoT data and its broader usages are also under way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Yue Hu and Yanbing Wang presented at NuerIPS 2019 workshop on Automatic Data Cleaning for Urban Sensor Networks.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/NIPS2019.JPG" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Future of Urban Transportation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/VU-magazine/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Future of Urban Transportation" /><published>2019-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/VU-magazine</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/VU-magazine/">&lt;p&gt;A recent article in Vanderbilt Magazine, by award-winning writer Stephen Ornes, featured interviews from Prof. Dan Work, Ph.D. student Will Barbour, and their colleages from Vanderbilt and VECTOR.
