					<p> Can we create a super-driver by analyzing the real-time data generated by a car, and closing the loop with the driver?
Today's cars operate with hundreds of signals using controller area network (CAN) that provide real-time information on the car and its surrounding environment. We are at an inflection point with cars, as smartphones in 2006, where we have an incredible ecosystem of technologies put together and only our imagination to limit what 'killer app' the future might hold. </p>
<p>We use CAN to create an application which enables drivers to follow control objectives with super-driver accuracy. We even pushed drivers to new limits by having them follow a leading 'Ghost Car' created totally in software. Six drivers tested various control objectives on the highway in the Nashville area.</p>
<p>This project seeks to test if we can use human-cyber-physical systems to do traffic wave smoothing and reduce energy spent by all cars in city traffic. Current work shows that individual drivers can achieve the kind of precise vehicle control needed to do traffic wave smoothing. Additional work will include exploring doing traffic wave smoothing with human drivers, and achieving super-drivers for more abstract and complex driving tasks like safety or energy improvement. There are plans to test experimental autonomous vehicle systems with the Ghost Car as well.</p>

					<p>Increasingly the make-up of traffic includes vehicles with partially autonomous features, such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). While it has been shown that careful control of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic can smooth traffic instabilities caused by human drivers, it has also been shown that currently available ACCs can fall victim to the same instabilities.</p> <p>This project will explore how connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to effectively smooth traffic instabilities. Currently, several Reinforcement Learning control methods have been developed that optimize for global smoothing. Experiments will be run in the future which involve real CAVs executing control algorithms in a freeway environment.</p>

					<p> Accurate vehicle trajectory information is the backbone on which modern traffic flow models are built and is also useful for appraising the effects of next-generation transportation technologies and methods on the stability of traffic flow. This work seeks to provide an accurate, real-time source for vehicle trajectory information by leveraging computer vision algorithms to process information from a camera sensor network. Current work seeks to accelerate existing methods for 3D object detection and multi-object tracking to real-time processing speeds. Additional work will include intelligently handling object occlusions and re-identifying objects in images from different camera views.</p>

					<p>Proliferation of shared urban mobility devices (SUMDs), particularly dockless e-scooters, has created opportunities for users desiring efficient, short trips. Simultaneously, these devices have raised management challenges for cities and regulators in terms of safety, infrastructure, and parking. There is a need in some high-demand areas for dedicated parking locations for dockless e-scooters and other devices.</p> <p>We use the data generated by SUMD trips for establishing locations of parking facilities and assessing their required capacity and anticipated utilization. The problem objective is: find locations for a given number of parking facilities that maximize the number of trips that could reasonably be ended and parked at these facilities. Posed another way, what is the minimum number and best locations of parking facilities needed to cover a desired portion of trips at these facilities?</p> <p>We find areas of high-density trip destination points using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to serve as parking locations. The dwell time of each device is used to estimate the number of devices parked in a location over time and the necessary capacity of the parking facility. We test these methods on scooter data totalling approximately 100,000 trips at Vanderbilt University. DBSCAN is the most effective algorithm tested for determining high-performing parking locations. A selection of 19 parking locations, is enough to capture roughly 25% of all trips in the dataset. The vast majority of parking facilities found require a mean capacity of 6 scooters when sized for the 98th percentile observed demand.</p>

					<p> This project explores methods for model parameter estimation on a car-following model using data collected from Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) enabled vehicles. The proposed methods are batch method least-squares and an online particle filter. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational performance of the methods relative to a commonly used simulation-based optimization approach. The methods are also assessed on empirical data collected from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle driven in a highway environment. Speed, space gap, and relative velocity data are recorded directly from the factory-installed radar unit via the vehicle’s CAN bus. The least-squares method has the fastest run-time performance, and is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than other methods. The particle filter is faster than real-time, and therefore is suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large.

						<b>Estimating arrival times on freight railroads using machine learning</b>

					<p>We have written a mixed integer linear optimization model that dispatches trains according to signaling constraints on single track railway lines with passing sidings and does so optimally according to the minimization of a weighted delay measure.</p> <p>This concept is similar to that used in commercial computer-aided dispatching systems, but those systems have the notable shortcoming of being overridden often in areas with complex dispatching situations. That is, they do not match the behavior of human dispatchers well. I propose to remedy this problem by performing inverse optimization according to known historical data for single track rail lines.</p> <p>Specifically, the forward optimization problem (dispatching trains) can be tuned to match historical dispatching behavior as closely as possible. The resulting dispatching model is a useful simulation tool that could be used for prediction of train arrivals, assessment of dispatching performance, investigation of track infrastructure layout, and schedule optimization.</p>

					<p>Numerous methods exist by which to estimate the arrival times (ETAs) of freight trains. Many have been applied to passenger rail, particularly in Europe. But few have investigated the predictability of freight railroads in the United States with large amounts of historical data. Using a dataset from CSX Transportation, we applied machine learning regression techniques on a rich feature set. The features mined from historical railroad operational data included train characteristics, crew information, and network state information.</p> <p>The dynamics of train operations across route segments is very complex and varied due to numerous factors including topography, locations of passing sidings, and locations of intermediate yards. For this reason, independent regression models were built for a series of discrete points across each route segment. The intuition behind this modeling decision is that the factors contributing to ETA prediction change as the train completes its route. This hypothesis is supported if significant changes are observed in regression feature weights between independent models.</p> <p>The methodology was tested on sections of the railroad with notoriously varied and unpredictable behavior. ETA predictive performance was compared to that of simple statisitcal methods, which are used in some prediction systems on the railroad. Results showed a consistent 20-30% improvement in prediction accuracy (mean average error) at the beginning of route segments.</p> <p>Feature weights did indeed change significantly between various regression models on the same route segment. In fact, difficult topographical areas were even identifiable by increased feature weight observed for train tonnage and length.</p>

					<p>This research project focuses on extreme events in urban transportation systems. Motivated by fast urbanization and increasing frequency of extreme weather events,  the need for methods to quantify infrastructure performance and resilience at city scales has become a priority. The research on extreme events can be greatly aided by high volume of empirical data collected recent years, such as the large taxi dataset published by New York city, or Waze app dataset collected in Nashville. Data may of course be sparse and is in some cases masked. However, the sheer volumn of data from various sources provides an underexploited starting point to understand how transportation systems respond to distuptions. <p>This project is aimed at finding a method that can overcome the constraints in high volume traffic data, and identify ''extreme'' behaviors from ''regular'' behaviors. Exploiting the regular patterns can be of help, which means we can rearrange the traffic data into higher dimensions. The porpose of the project is to develop a reliable algorithm to analysis the massive city traffic data in tensor format, and give a better insight on traffic pattern and extreme event behavior.

					<p>Low cost urban sensing networks enhance our understanding of cites and urban life. The impacts of mitigation strategies in communities can be measured at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this project applies robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. <p>The  method is applied to the <a href='https://arrayofthings.github.io/'>Array of Things (AoT) </a> city-scale sensor network. Located in the City of Chicago, IL, AoT collects real time data on the city's environment and activity with more than 90 nodes. Further analysis of AoT data and its broader usages are also under way.

					<p>Despite important advances in computation and sensing, real-time traffic estimation problems are still open to a number of critical issues including: (i) the entire state of the transportation network is too large for the estimators to scale in real time; (ii) few results are available which provide a theoretical analysis of the performance of traffic estimation algorithm, and (iii) the non-observability of the traffic model is inevitable due to the existence of shocks and the sparsity of sensor measurements.</p> <p>Our work aims at designing scalable distributed traffic estimation algorithms to address issues (i) and (ii) with specific care of issue (iii). Large-scale networks can be partitioned into overlapping local sections, with the traffic density on each local section described by a traffic model on the local state, and estimated by a cheap commodity computer (e.g., an agent).  The main algorithmic challenge is to obtain theoretical bounds on the performance of the estimator, even as the system state switches between observable and unobservable modes. We are also interested in the development of estimation algorithms when with performance guarantees when not all sensor data can be transmitted due to energy and communication costs.</p>

					<p>While it may be a long time before all the vehicles on our roadways are completely automated (if ever), it is likely that in the near future there will be an increasing number of autonomous (or partially autonomous) vehicles. These vehicles will likely drive somewhat differently than human drivers, and will thus influence the traffic dynamics. Similar to the shift from Eularian to Lagrangian traffic state estimation that occured when GPS-enabled smartphones entered the mainstream, a similar shift from Eularian control (control at fixed locations in the infrastructure, e.g., ramp metering) to Lagrangian control in the traffic flow may be possible, even with just a small number of autonomous vehicles in the traffic that can be controlled to control the overall traffic flow.</p> <p>The goal of this project is to identify the extent to which a small number of autonomous vehicles in the traffic flow (e.g., 5% of vehicles) are able to alter the traffic dynamics and mitigate adverse emergent phenomena such as traffic oscillations or phantom traffic jams. The work includes both theoretical contributions on traffic stability as well as extensive experimental work demonstrating the ability of a single autonomous vehicle in a flow of 20 human-piloted vehicles to completely eliminate traffic instabilities reducing overall fuel consumption by nearly 40%.</p>

					<p>The enormous and rapidly increasing amount of traffic data opens tremendous opportunities for the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, real time traffic estimation and optimal traffic management in safety critical environments are still open problems. One example occurs in rural work zones, where existing sensor coverage is sparse.</p> <p>Our work aims at improving ITS in safety-critical situations via: <em>i)</em> the development of a low-cost and low-power wireless sensor network for traffic monitoring in work zones; <em>ii)</em> the development of mathematical traffic models on networks for amenable for optimal traffic management. In this work, a low-cost and low-power wireless traffic sensor platform is built using the passive infrared camera and machine learning algorithms to detect vehicles and estimate the traffic speed. Concurrently, we are developing a theoretical framework traffic estimation and optimal traffic management for networks of conservation laws. The developed sensor network, a variety of traffic estimation algorithms (including ensemble Kalman filter and Particle filter), and the optimal traffic management (using convex programs) are simulated and validated in micro-simulation environment.</p>

					<p>Predictive maintenance of machinery has recently become a higher-performance methodology compared to traditional condition-based maintenance. This is due to improved sensing capabilities through the internet of things (IoT) and renewed interest in machine learning methods that perform diagnosis well. Fault states as well as machine health values can be predicted in some cases.</p> <p>We are interested in classifying electric motor failure conditions using accelerometer data, with specific application for traction motors on railroad locomotives. Machine learning classifiers were first trained and tested on motor data from a test bench to make the binary prediction of faulty or healthy condition. Ensemble models were then developed to make the multi-label classification of which fault, or which combination of fault, are present in a motor.</p>

					<p>TrafficTurk is a mobile application that allows easy collection of traffic data.  The app functions as a turning movement counter - the user stands at an intersection and swipes the screen when a vehicle passes.  The user swipes the trajectory of the car on an intersection image - different types of swipes correspond to various types  of turns.  All of these turns are sent wirelessly to a central server in realtime, so they can be analyzed and stored in a database. The purpose of TrafficTurk is to collect data on a large scale during unusual events. Ideally, many users will simultaneously collect data at nearby intersections in order to get a complete picture of the traffic patterns.  The server sends a map to the app, allowing users to scroll around and see various intersections.  They choose the one that they intend to collect data at, and begin counting. TrafficTurk is designed for the worst-case scenario.  During some types of unusual events, mobile networks become crowded or even fail entirely.  For this reason, the app must be able to function with intermittent or absent internet connections.  To support this, the app can easily pre-cache all of the intersections in an area.  In this way, it is possible to count at these intersections even if there are no mobile networks available near them.  Similarly, the app maintains a cache of collected data which only clears once the server has received it.  In this way, the app has a 100% data collection guarantee as long as the phone eventually connects to a wireless network.</p>

					<p>Joint traffic state estimation and incident detection is a critical problem for both traffic monitoring and highway safety. In this project, multiple model filtering techniques (e.g., particle filter and Kalman filter) and macroscopic traffic flow models are proposed to jointly estimate the traffic state and detect traffic incidents in real-time using sensor data. The algorithms are tested through incident data generated by a microscopic traffic simulation software (CORSIM) and field data collected from the mobile century experiment by Berkeley, 2008. The left figure shows the traffic density evolution from a CORSIM simulation, where the red area in the plot indicates the traffic congestion caused by an incident.</p>

					<p>In life cycle assessment, when product systems are optimized to minimize environmental impacts, uncertainty in the process data may impact optimal decisions. In this project, a robust optimization approach is proposed for decision making under uncertainty at the life cycle inventory stage. The level of protection against data uncertainty can be controlled to reflect varying degrees of conservatism. The left figure shows the comparison between the proposed robust optimization approach (red) and deterministic optimization approach (blue) in terms of carbon oxygen output for an electricity generation problem with varying degrees of protection against data uncertainty.</p>

						<b>Quantifying resilience with coarse GPS data</b>

					<p>What effects do natural disasters have on our transportation infrastructure?  How resilient are our cities to extreme events, and how quickly do they recover?  Our work aims to answer these questions in a way that is low-cost and practical, by analyzing millions of GPS records from taxis equipped with GPS.  In this way, it is possible to determine the pace of traffic (i.e., travel time per mile) between various regions of the city, and detect atypical congestion. Our method is tested using a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips from New York City.  We have made the dataset publicly available <a title='Open data' href='/data'>here</a>.</p> <p>The basic idea is that city traffic conditions follow a fairly periodic pattern.  The figure (left) shows the average pace (travel time per mile) between various regions of the city over the course of three weeks (East of the Hudson, Upper Manhattan, Midtown, and Lower Manhattan).  High travel times are obvious during rush hour each day, especially in the Midtown-to-Midtown trips (M-M).</p> <p>On a particular day, the traffic conditions may deviate significantly from this expected behavior.  This is usually due to an extreme event such as a natural disaster or bad weather conditions.  Based on this deviation, it is possible to measure how "usual" or "unusual" the traffic conditions are.  For more information about how this probabilistic computation is performed, see our paper:</p> <p>Brian Donovan and Daniel B. Work. Using coarse GPS data to quantify city-scale transportation system resilience to extreme events.  presented at the<em> </em><em>Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting, January 2015. </em> <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/deruyszudfqrll0/TRB15DonovanWork.pdf'>preprint</a>, <a href='https://github.com/UIUC-Transportation-Data/gpsresilience'>source code</a>.</p> <p>You can also download the data here:  <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.13012/J8PN93H8'>http://dx.doi.org/10.13012/J8PN93H8</a></p> <p>Brian Donovan and Daniel B.

This result  indicates that there is room for further research in the post-disaster process of repopulating the city after an evacuation.</p>
