name: "Artificial Intelligence-Powered Decision Support Tools for Integrated Corridor Management on Interstate 24 Smart Corridor"

description: "<p>FHWA’s ATCMTD program funds early deployments of forward-looking technologies that can serve as national models. Our project, funded through this program, partners with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) to build a Artificial Intelligence Decision Support System (AI-DSS) on Interstate 24. Our project will use AI to advance a comprehensive Integrated Corridor Management system – part of the multiphase, 28-mile-long I-24 Smart Corridor project along that interstate and connecting highways and state routes. It will help address the challenges to creating a successful and comprehensive ICM system that include, for example, increased congestion, high incident rates and limited real-time performance monitoring. Physical improvements will be made along the existing I-24 corridor including extending ramp lengths, adding emergency pull-offs, and installing ramp meters. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) features will also be deployed to upgrade signals and optimize signal timing on SR 1 and the connector routes and to provide information boards on both I-24 and SR 1. This project will be completed in 3 phases and is currently in phase 2, set to complete in Spring of 2023. <strong>Project: </strong><a href='https://www.tn.gov/tdot/projects/region-3/i-24-smart-corridor.html'>webpage</a></p>"
