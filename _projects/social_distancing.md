name: "Quantifying Social Distancing Compliance Using Computer Vision"

description: "<p> Social distancing has become a pressing and challenging issue during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a smart cities context, it is possible to measure inter-personal distance using networked cameras and computer vision analysis. We deploy a computer vision pipeline based on Retinanet that identifies pedestrians in continuously streaming video frames, then converts their positions to GPS coordinates for distance calculation and further analysis. This processing is applied to nine camera streams at three locations across Vanderbilt University's campus. We collected 70 hours of baseline distancing data over the course of two weeks, after which time we deployed small behavioral interventions at the three locations aimed at increasing distancing compliance. Another 70 hours of data with the interventions in place will be analyzed against the baseline data to determine if we can increase social distancing compliance.</p>"
