name: "Fast and Accurate Vehicle Turning-Movement Counting at Intersections and Along Roadways"

description: "<p> Despite the high utility of traffic volume and turning movement data, such data is still hard to come by for the vast majority of roadways and intersections in nearly every city. Edge computing devices offer a promising tool for recording turning movement data if lightweight algorithms can be designed to run in real-time with relatively modest computational complexity. We utilize our fast-tracking approach for traffic counting without ever performing (slow) object detection on an overall frame of video. Instead, only a few portions of the image are cropped and used to detect objects within the frame. The method achieves competitive performance on the public evaluation server for Track 1 of the 2021 AI City Challenge (7th overall on the first 50% of data), and significantly speeds vehicle counting relative to a traditional tracking-by-detection-based approach.</p>"
