description: "<p> Can we create a super-driver by analyzing the real-time data generated by a car, and closing the loop with the driver?

Today's cars operate with hundreds of signals using a controller area network (CAN) that provides real-time information on the car and its surrounding environment. We are at an inflection point with cars, as smartphones in 2006, where we have an incredible ecosystem of technologies assembled and only our imagination to limit what 'killer app' the future might hold. </p>

<p>We use CAN to create an application which enables drivers to follow control objectives with super-driver accuracy. We even pushed drivers to new limits by having them follow a leading 'Ghost Car' created totally in software. Six drivers tested various control objectives on the highway in the Nashville area.</p>

<p>This project seeks to test if we can use human-cyber-physical systems to do traffic wave smoothing and reduce energy spent by all cars in city traffic. Current work shows that individual drivers can achieve the kind of precise vehicle control needed to do traffic wave smoothing. Additional work will include exploring doing traffic wave smoothing with human drivers, and achieving super-drivers for more abstract and complex driving tasks like safety or energy improvement. There are plans to test experimental autonomous vehicle systems with the Ghost Car as well.</p>"
