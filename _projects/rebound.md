name: "Quantifying traffic due to potential COVID-19 commute mode shifts"

description: "<p>This work is done in cooperation with teams from Cornell and UT Austin, to quantify the sensitivity of commute travel times in about a hundred US metro areas, due to potential changes in commute patterns after COVID-19 from transit and carpooling to single occupancy vehicles (SOV). Bayesian regression model is applied on US census data to relate commute travel time to the number of passenger vehicles. Findings are covered in more than 30 medias, including  <a href='https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-transit/empty-trains-clogged-roads-americans-get-behind-the-wheel-to-avoid-transit-idUSKBN22W29X'>Reuters</a>,

  <a href='https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/how-mta-commuting-in-nyc-will-look-after-the-coronavirus/'>New York Post</a> and so on.</p>
<p>The findings of The Rebound study are coalesced into the <a href='https://lab-work.github.io/therebound/'> Rebound Calculator</a>. The tool estimates one-way commute travel times using models built around recent commuting data for most U.S. metro areas. As the number of vehicles on the roads increases, so too does the travel time, according to a traffic fundamental called the BPR model. Travel times, therefore, increase if existing commuters switch from transit or carpool to single-occupancy vehicles. Travel times will decrease if fewer vehicles are on the road due to unemployment or remote work. How mode shift could affect travel times is particularly important in the era or Covid-19, as it could impart high cost on commuters due to increased time spent in traffic.</p>"
