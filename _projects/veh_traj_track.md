name: "Large-scale, Efficient Vehicle Trajectory Extraction from Cameras"

description: "<p> Accurate vehicle trajectory information is the backbone on which modern traffic flow models are built and is also useful for appraising the effects of next-generation transportation technologies and methods on the stability of traffic flow. This work seeks to provide an accurate, real-time source for vehicle trajectory information by leveraging computer vision algorithms to process information from a camera sensor network. 

The backbone of this work is a novel fast-tracking algorithm developed to drastically reduce the time taken to detect and track objects, especially in sparsely occupied, high-resolution video sequences. This work uses existing tracked object locations as priors for object locations in the current frame, extracting and processing only these relevant regions to detect objects and update vehicle trajectories. 

Future work on this project will follow 3 main goals:
- Tracking objects as 3D objects in real-world space rather than as 2D objects in image space to increase position estimation accuracy.
- Re-identifying objects across a large-scale camera network for continuous tracking.
- Automatic handoffs and cross-camera management of tracked objects to further increase accuracy and efficiency.
