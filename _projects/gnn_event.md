description: "<p> Accurate and timely detection of large events on urban transportation networks enables informed mobility management. This work tackles the problem of extreme event detection on large scale transportation networks using origin-destination mobility data, which is now widely available. Such data is highly structured in time and space, but high dimensional and sparse. Current multivariate time series anomaly detection methods cannot fully address these challenges. To exploit the structure of mobility data, we formulate the event detection problem in a novel way, as detecting anomalies in a set of time dependent directed weighted graphs. We further propose a Context augmented Graph Autoencoder (Con-GAE) model to solve the problem, which leverages graph embedding and context embedding techniques to capture the spatial and temporal patterns. Con-GAE adopts an autoencoder framework and detects anomalies via semi-supervised learning.</p>
<p>The performance of the method is assessed on several city-scale travel time datasets from Uber Movement, New York taxi and Chicago taxi, and compared to state of the art approaches. The proposed Con-GAE can achieve a 0.1-0.4 improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) score compared to the baselines. We also discuss real-world traffic anomalies detected by Con-GAE.   </p>"
