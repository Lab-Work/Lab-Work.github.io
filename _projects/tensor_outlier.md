name: "Extreme Event Detection from Massive Transportation Data"

description: "<p>This research project focuses on extreme events in urban transportation systems. Motivated by fast urbanization and increasing frequency of extreme weather events,  the need for methods to quantify infrastructure performance and resilience at city scales has become a priority. The research on extreme events can be greatly aided by high volume of empirical data collected recent years, such as the large taxi dataset published by New York city, or Waze app dataset collected in Nashville. Data may of course be sparse and is in some cases masked. However, the sheer volumn of data from various sources provides an underexploited starting point to understand how transportation systems respond to distuptions. 
<p>This project is aimed at finding a method that can overcome the constraints in high volume traffic data, and identify ''extreme'' behaviors from ''regular'' behaviors. Exploiting the regular patterns can be of help, which means we can rearrange the traffic data into higher dimensions. The porpose of the project is to develop a reliable algorithm to analysis the massive city traffic data in tensor format, and give a better insight on traffic pattern and extreme event behavior."
