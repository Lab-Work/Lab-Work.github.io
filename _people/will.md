description: "<p>William Barbour is a senior research scientist at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. He currently works on the I-24 MOTION testbed, seeking to establish a preeminent study area for automated vehicle technologies on an open roadway in Tennessee, and the I-24 Smart Corridor, an integrated corridor management project driven by a custom AI decision support system.</p>
<p>Dr. Barbour received his Ph.D. in civil engineering from Vanderbilt University, an M.S. degree in sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a B.S. in Biosystems Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Dr. Barbour has previously worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CSX Transportation. He has also received graduate funding support from the Roadway Safety Institute and Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>William’s career and research interests focus on the application of novel and advanced computational techniques to transportation systems engineering; examples include big data analytics, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. He has applied these interests in the freight rail transportation domain through ongoing industry collaboration with Class I railroads, where improvements in network operations can lead to capacity and efficiency gains for the system. William’s other domain interests include pedestrian and cyclist accessibility, public transit planning, and transportation policy.</p>
<p>In addition to research, William teaches with Vanderbilt Programs for Talented Youth. During three summers and four weekend programs, he planned and taught *Sensors and Big Data Analysis* and *Electrical engineering, sensors, and control*, to gifted high school students from across the United States and abroad. The classes include hands-on experiences for students in sensor prototyping, data collection, data analysis, and automation robotics."
