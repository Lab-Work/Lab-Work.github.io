description: "<p>Junyi Ji is a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering and the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. He earned his M.S. in Transportation Engineering at B.S. in Traffic Engineering from Southeast University, China. 

Junyi's primary interest is to better understand and predict the microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics, and to formulate new control strategies to improve efficiency, stability and safety of highway systems. His current research is focusing on smoothing traffic trajectories at scale with application on the I-24 MOTION testbed. 

Junyiâ€™s other domain interests include data-driven approaches in sustainable transportation (road safety, active mode traffic, and environmental impacts). Sustainablity is his pursuit. </p>"
