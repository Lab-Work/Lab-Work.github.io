description: "<p>Junyi Ji is a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering and the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. He earned his M.S. in Transportation Engineering and B.Eng. in Traffic Engineering from Southeast University, China. 

Junyi's primary interest is to better understand the microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics and to formulate control strategies to improve the efficiency and safety of freeway systems. He is actively involved in freeway traffic testbed development and field experiments. His current research is focusing on smoothing traffic trajectories at scale with application on the I-24 MOTION testbed.

Junyiâ€™s other domain interests include data-driven approaches in sustainable transportation (road safety, active mode traffic, and environmental impacts). He has served as a volunteer since 2017 for SustainableCity, a top-tier volunteer organization in China focused on sustainability. He also serves for MoveVU, aimed at transitioning Vanderbilt towards a future of sustainable mobility. His long-term research vision is to integrate AI and CPS technology with transportation to create a sustainable system in response to climate change. </p>"
