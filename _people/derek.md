description: "<p>Derek Gloudemans is a PhD. student in computer science at Vanderbilt University. His undergraduate degree was in civil engineering from Vanderbilt University, where he graduated summa cum laude. Derek has work experience from the Indiana Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>Derekâ€™s career and research interests focus on the usage of computational techniques to address large-scale and multiparameter problems traditionally solved using human intuition, with a particular emphasis on computer vision. Current work focuses on leveraging creating real-time methods for tracking objects across multiple continuous camera fields of view. Past projects have included fast joint object tracking and detection algorithms, utilizing computational techniques to analyze social distancing compliance, algorithms for vehicle turning movement counting at intersections on edge compute devices, and fault detection in the freight rail sector using machine learning. Derek is also interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, data science, and public policy.</p>"
degrees: "<li>Ph.D, Computer Science, CEE, Vanderbilt University 2023 (expected)</li>
<li>B.S., Civil and Environmental Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, 2018</li>"
